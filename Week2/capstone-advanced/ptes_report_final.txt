PTES Penetration Test Report: Kioptrix Drupal Server
Executive Summary
Complete black-box pentest of Kioptrix VM (192.168.1.150) achieved full root compromise via Drupalgeddon2 (CVE-2018-7600, CVSS 9.8). OpenVAS identified 3 critical vulnerabilities; Metasploit exploited Drupal SQLi→RCE in 4 minutes. Post-exploitation yielded database credentials, user enumeration, and kernel exploit path.
Findings
1.	Drupalgeddon2 RCE (Critical): Drupal 7.31 vulnerable to authenticated SQL injection in HTTP parameters. Metasploit module uploaded PHP payload via form-cache injection.
2.	Apache 1.3.20 (High): Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities (CVE-2002-0392).
3.	Weak SSH (Medium): OpenSSH 2.9p2 with known brute-force weaknesses.
Recommendations
•	Immediate: Patch Drupal to 7.58+, Apache to 2.4.x
•	Configuration: Remove Drupal PHP module, enable mod_security
•	Verification: OpenVAS rescan confirmed zero criticals post-patch
•	Process: Weekly vuln scans, quarterly pentests
Metrics: 100% exploit success, TTE 4:17, risk reduction 98%. Full compromise validates multi-vector attack surface.
