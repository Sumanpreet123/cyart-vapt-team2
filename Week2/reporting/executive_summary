Executive Summary
DVWA penetration test (192.168.1.200) identified 4 vulnerabilities across OWASP Top 10 categories A03 (Injection), A07 (Auth), A01 (XSS), A08 (CSRF). Critical SQL injection enables full database dump; chained attacks achieve RCE. Risk: Complete data compromise. All remediations verified post-fix.
Technical Findings
•	F001 SQL Injection: Login form vulnerable to ' OR 1=1-- bypass. sqlmap dumps users table.
•	F002 Weak Auth: admin:password default creds. No lockout mechanism.
•	F003 XSS: Reflected payload <script>alert(1)</script> executes without sanitization.
•	F004 CSRF: POST requests lack tokens; session actions hijackable.
Remediation Plan
1.	Deploy PDO prepared statements for all DB queries
2.	Enforce password policy (12+ chars, complexity) + MFA
3.	Add CSP headers: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
4.	Implement CSRF tokens with unique session binding
5.	Monthly automated scans + annual pentests

Verification: Post-remediation OpenVAS scan: 0 critical findings
